# **Diabetes Prediction Project**
This project aims to develop a predictive model for diabetes diagnosis using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, which contains various health measurements of individuals.


**Project Overview**
The objective of this project is to predict whether an individual has diabetes or not based on their health attributes.
The project utilizes a variety of machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), as well as ensemble techniques such as Bagging and Boosting.
The performance of each algorithm is evaluated using accuracy metrics and compared to identify the most effective approach.


**Methods Used**
Logistic Regression: This algorithm is used as a baseline for diabetes prediction and provides insight into the linear relationship between features and the target variable.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): SVM is employed to capture complex relationships and create a decision boundary to classify individuals into diabetic or non-diabetic groups.
Ensemble Techniques:
Bagging: Bagging combines multiple models to reduce variance and improve prediction accuracy. It utilizes the Bootstrap aggregation technique to generate diverse subsets of the dataset for training each model.
Boosting: Boosting combines weak models iteratively to create a strong model. It focuses on instances that are misclassified by previous models to improve overall prediction performance.


**Results**
The performance of each algorithm is evaluated using accuracy scores and other relevant metrics.
Logistic Regression, SVM, Bagging, and Boosting are compared in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
The best-performing algorithm is identified based on these metrics and used for the final diabetes prediction model.


**Getting Started**
The project requires Python and relevant libraries such as scikit-learn for implementing the machine learning algorithms.
The Pima Indians Diabetes dataset is provided in CSV format and can be loaded for analysis and model training.


**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the application of various machine learning techniques for diabetes prediction.
By comparing multiple algorithms, including logistic regression, SVM, and ensemble methods like Bagging and Boosting, we identify the most accurate and reliable approach for diabetes prediction.
The developed model can be utilized for early diabetes diagnosis, leading to timely interventions and improved healthcare outcomes.
